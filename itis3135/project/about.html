                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p id="story">
                    Property Pros LLC was founded in 2010 by Jon Gross, a now small-business owner, husband, and father of two. We started out working on solely commercial projects, but with the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we expanded our services to residential as well, as there was a higher demand for residential services. We are headquartered in Apex, North Carolina and employ over 25 professional subcontractors, hence our name Property Pros.

                    Our services are available to surrounding areas, including Apex, Cary, Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, and others. We have been serving cities of North Carolina for over 11 years now, and strive to provide the best experience possible.
