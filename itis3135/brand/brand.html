        <p>The genus <em>Gorilla</em> is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, as well as four or five different subspecies. We rescue any type of gorilla! 
        They are predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that live in the tropical forests of equatorial Africa.
        They have DNA that is highly similar to that of humans, making then the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.
        Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25-1.8 metres, weights between 100-270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres.
        Gorillas are herbivores and their natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa.Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. 
        The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.

        A gorilla's day is divided between rest periods and travel or feeding periods. Diets differ between and within species. Mountain gorillas mostly eat foliage, such as leaves, stems, pith, and shoots, while fruit makes up a very small part of their diets. Mountain gorilla food is widely distributed and neither individuals nor groups have to compete with one another. Their home ranges vary from 3 to 15 km2 (1.2 to 5.8 sq mi), and their movements range around 500 m (0.31 mi) or less on an average day. Despite eating a few species in each habitat, mountain gorillas have flexible diets and can live in a variety of habitats.</p>

            There are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas. Both species are classified as <em>Critically Endangered</em>. Jumbo Gorilla Enterprises would love to collaborate with you to see if you are a qualified client to ensure that our gorillas are in a safe home.
