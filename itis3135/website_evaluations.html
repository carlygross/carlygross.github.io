                <p>
                    The Yale School of Art website is quite a terrible website. It is simply all over the place when it comes to graphics and color scheme, and the layout is poorly designed.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Contrast - There are some textboxes that contrast from the black and white background, but there are white textboxes that blend right into the background, which is not good in this case. The creator should try to stick to a theme and make the textboxes more similar to each other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repetition - There does not appear to be any type of theme to this website, it all seems very random and lacks repetition. They should try to use similar shapes and elements across the website to bring some type of consistency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alignment - Everything on this site is aligned to the left of the screen, leaving a right margin that is wider than half of the page. The alignment structure of the page is not the most visually appealing. I would suggest shrinking the right margin to make the page go across the whole screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Proximity - The large right margin causes a lot of the information to be condensed to the left side of the screen, lowering readability. Especially if the right margin shrinks, it would be beneficial to spread out the information across the whole width of the page to make it easier to read.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <br><h3><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Microsoft has a website that I expect to be top-tier, and it does follow CRAP principles well.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Contrast - They use a primarily black and white color scheme, apart from some pops of color, that works well and naturally creates a lot of visually appealing contrast.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repetition - Clickable items and articles on this website are all formatted the same way, creating consistency, and makes the page quite easy to navigate and understand.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alignment - The margins are the same width on either side and they are maximizing the amount of information they can fit on a page, which is a good thing in this case. The alignment is aesthetically pleasing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Proximity - This website is easy to read, as it is not cluttered with text, nor are any images placed too close to or on top of each other.
                    </li>
                </ul>
